My personal website

This repo is my first official repository and I consider it a playground to test out my skills and new ideas
as I progress through my coursework and enhance my skills. I'm currently working my way through codecademy's
Full Stack Engineer career path and have finished the HTML fundamentals and am about to finish the CSS fundamentals.
After that, I will be tackling their JS fundamentals to round out the big three of front end development.


I hope to apply those skills here and upgrade and update this repo as they progress.

If you stumble across this repo and feel the desire to critique or comment, it is more than welcome.

Cheers!
